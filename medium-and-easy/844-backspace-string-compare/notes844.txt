The initial thought to solve this is to start from the front and build out the string.

This will take about O(N) time and will require O(N) space, because we would need to store another full string.



However, if we start from the back avoid a lot of problem where we need to back track when we see a backspace.

If we start from the back, we can consider when we meet a #, we need to keep track of number of backspaces, then when we see a normal character, we can simply move on with the next part of the string.
