Two Solution

1. Recursive
Just divide keep dividing by 2, if we ever see there's a remainder that's bigger than 0, then return false, and if at the end we get 1, then it is power of 2

2. Binary
All power of twos in binary will have binary of 10.....0
2 = 10
4 = 100
7 = 111
8 = 1000
16= 10000

So if we shift the binary right by 1 bit and then left by 1 bit, power of twos will have the exact same binary, so we just write a while loop to keep checking if there's any occurrence where after we shift right and then left, the number is different.
