These kind of questions, where we need to get next items, like in 173 where we need to get the next minimum, can all be resolved using queue.

The easiest and most straightforward solution is always on init, loop through the entire collection and put them in a queue.

Anohter way to do this is by using a stack, where at first we push all the item on the list onto the stack.

Then when we call next, if we encounter an integer, simple pop the stack and return the integer.
if we encounter a list, then we need to call another function to recursively push the list onto the stack.

This can be done but I didn't write out the solution, since it probably will not be good for speed performance and memory space is not that optimal either.
