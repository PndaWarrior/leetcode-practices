We use two pointer, one going faster and one going slower.

If there's a cycle, then the faster pointer will eventually meet the slower pointer.

What we can do is just check whether the faster pointer ever meets or passes the slower pointer.

Theoretically though, there's proof that the faster pointer will always meet the slower pointer at some point, but in case we pass by it, I also check the pointer where my faster pointer jumps through.
