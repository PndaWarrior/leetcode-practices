This is a DP question with memoization.

We use an array dp to keep track that for dp[n], how many ways can we get to that step.

Since we know at the nth step, there's always two ways to get to it, either 1 step or 2 step.

And if we look, at the (n-1) steps, we could've taken 1 step to get to n, and there might be some number of ways to get to (n-1) step.

our dp function remembers that, so dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2];
