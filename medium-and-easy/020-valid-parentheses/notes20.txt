The algorithm is simple.

We know that for a valid parentheses, there are two main conditions.
1. The open bracket and close parentheses must have the exact same numbers
2. When we encounter an open parentheses, the following must either be a matching close parentheses or another open parentheses

Therefore, we just keep all the open parentheses that we encounter onto a stack, if we find a close parentheses we check to see if the top of the stack is a matching open parentheses, if it is then we can simply pop the stack, if not then we know it's not a valid parentheses.

At the end of the loop, we need to check if the stack is empty, if it is, then there's no more parentheses to be matched so it's a valid parentheses
