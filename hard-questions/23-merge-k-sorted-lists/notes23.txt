Brute force, compare each of the first item and return the smallest, iterate until all of the items are cleared out.
O(kn)

Second brute force, merge all into one list and sort, O(n) + O(nlogn);

Using heap, I just need to store all of the first items in the list since the list themselves are already sorted.
Keep iterating until the heap is gone, and since it's a min heap i always get the smallest number if I poll.

O(nlogk), insert and remove takes logk time, since there are n number of nodes so it's O(nlogk)
