The trick to this problem is to think about the pattern of how we generate a subset.


Given a subset of 3 unique items, we should look at each one one by one

[1,2,3]

First we start with 1 subset of no items.  And we store this in our result List.


Current List
{ {} }

At index 0, we generate a duplicate List and add item 0

{ {}, {1} }

At index 1, we generate duplicate list of all current subsets and add item 1

{ {}, {2}, {1}, {1,2} }

At index 2, we generate dpulicate set for all current subsets and add item 2


{ {}, {3}, {1}, {1,3}, {2}, {2,3}, {1,2}, {1,2,3} }


If we generate this way, then we can use an iterative approach to solve this problem.


We can also use a recursive approach, which is similar in concept.
