My solution is just a bunch of switch statements.

We know what each of the value in the Roman character is worth, so we have a switch case for each character.
HOWEVER, we have a couple of special cases,
I is normally +1 but if it comes before V or X, it has -1 value
X is normally + 10 but if it comes before L or C, it has - 10
C is normally + 100 but if it comes before D or M, it has - 100

As long as we take care of the special cases, then we should be good.
