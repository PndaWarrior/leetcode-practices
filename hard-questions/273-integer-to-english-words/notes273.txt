The idea is simple, we will basically need to repeat the calculation of every 3 digits.

For example, 12,012,000
Twelve Million Twelve Thousand.

We can solve this by DP, where we solve every 3 digits of 1000, we just need to keep track of the level we're on, so we can determine whether we're at million or billion or thousand.
