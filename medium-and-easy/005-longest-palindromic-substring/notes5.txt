The easiest way to solve this is by moving the center and expanding from the center to try and find the palindrome.

For each index, we would check two cases, first case is where the current index is the center of a palindrome and second case is where the center is between the current index and the next index.

Some special notes written in the code itself.
Remember that, 5/2 and 4/2 are the same thing in java Integers, because decimals are dropped when dividing an integer.
Remember that, when you right a While loop check, it will always do one last step, take into consideration whether you want that last step to be included or not.

Remeber, javascript is not strongly typed, if we want to do the same calculation as java where 5/2 = 4/2, we have to use the floor method.
