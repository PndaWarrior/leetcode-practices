1. Brute force

for each index i, look to the right and the left to see what the max right and left walls are and then determine current amount of rain water by Min(rightWall, leftWall) - current


2. Split this problem in two
Let's think about how does a rain water capture work

consider the case
[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

At index 2, we know that there's a wall to the right, which is 2, the left wall is 1 so we know at index 2 we trap 1 unit of water.  Calculation is Min(leftWall, rightWall) - current height.

However, we know this will be the same case if the right wall is 3, or 4, or 5.  So we know it doesn't really matter what the bigger wall is, since the smaller wall is what dictates the unit of water captured

We can simplify this problem by saying that, if I know what's the tallest wall is at one certain location, I can split this problem into two part, where all the units to the left of the big wall can be calculated by - currentLeftMax - currentHeight, but if currentHeight is taller, then the currentHeight replaces currentLeftMax.

This turns the problem into O(n) and we have to iterate n 2 times.


3.
This can be simplified even further.  I don't really need to know what's the biggest wall for the entire array.  I only need to know for an index, what's the biggest wall to the left and what's the biggest wall to the right, and the smallest is what I will use to calculate the unit.  I can just have two pointers going from either end, and I iterate through the array, finding the current rightMax and currentLeftMax, and I move the pointers one by one.  If leftMax is smaller than rightMax, then I check the left index to see what's the unit and calculate using the left wall, and vice versa.
