The basic idea I have is, set the first string as the current Longest common Prefix.

Check the current longest prefix with the current string, find the longest prefix and save the result as the current longest common prefix.
Keep repeating for every character in the array.

This has O(m*n), where m is number of strings in array, and n is the number of characters in a string where ALL of the strings in the array are the exact same.


To optimize this, we can use a binary search to find the longest common prefix, rather than a linear search, this will make it so the run time is O(m*log(n));
