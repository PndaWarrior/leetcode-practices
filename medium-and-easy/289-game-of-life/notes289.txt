The idea is simple, we have 5 rules,
1, live now but dies
2, live now and live
3, live now but dies
4, dead now but lives
5, dead now and dead

We just need to count the neighbors, and then apply the rules.

Intuitively, we can store the state in a list or a map or another 2d array.  However this prevents us from solving this in place.

In order to solve this in place, our original 2D array need to keep track of the old state and the intermediate state, and then apply the new state.

For example, a live cell is 1, but a live cell that's going to die we can indicate it as 2, so when we do the counting, we can also count a neighbor as living if it has value of 2.

Once all the intermediate states are resolved, we can just loop through the array again and simply change the values based on the intermediate state.
